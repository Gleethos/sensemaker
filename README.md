# sensemaker - a photo database / viewer #

This is the first full desktop application
I wrote!<br>
The project was built as part of the second
software development class in the 4th semester at the
U.A.S. Technikum.

The application is similar to most other photo databases / viewers,
except that I added a distinguishing feature, namely : Multi-Touch support. <br>
Although the application is usable and stable, there are still
many mocked aspects about the software that I will not finish simply
because the application was intended as a learning experience and not
a commercial product. <br>
